Timeline
========

A simple [Laravel][1]-based web application for displaying and maintaining a
timeline of events, kinda like the one at [JetBrains' 25 Years of PHP History][2].

This project is currently a work in progress, and I'm using it to learn
and try out some things, so adjust your expectations accordingly.
